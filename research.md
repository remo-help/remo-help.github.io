## German Adjectives and Degree Modification
_Dissertation Project_

I am working on the Syntax and Semantics of degree modification in German adjectives. What is of particular interest to me is the German modifier_viel_ (compare English ''much'') and its selectional properties. _Viel_ seems to select for events over states in verbs, nominals, and adjectives, yet it also selects for comparatives. I believe that deriving a consistent syntactic and semantic analysis of this pattern can inform on the status of adjectives generally and contribute to the discussion on Bresnan 1973's hypothesis on English _much_.

## Language Evolution: CENA
_Collaboration with: Anderson Almeida da Silva (Universidade Federal do Delta do Parnaíba), Shigeru Miyagawa (MIT and University of São Paulo), and Vitor Nóbrega (University of Hamburg)_

_CENA_ is an emergent sign language in Piauí, Brasil, that arose out of a homesign system some 70 years ago (Almeida da Silva & Nevins 2020). We are working on a joint research project to show that (i) humans do not need an external model of language, but can instead devise one of their own (an argument already made by Goldin-Meadow and colleagues in their work on homesign, see for example Brentari \& Goldin-Meadow 2017), and (ii) that a homesign system can quickly progress into a full-fledged sign language if there is a community that uses it. While similar arguments have been made on the case of Nicaraguan Sign Language, we argue that _CENA_ is different because it was not subject to any outside influences during its genesis due to the fact that it arose in a remote village with no access to other sign languages or sign language educators.


## Informative Event Extraction for Dynamic Domains
_Collaboration with: Yuwei Wang, Chen Chen (University of Arizona)_

The team I lead within the ToMCAT project maintains a rule based event extraction (EE) system. The domain we work in consists of spontaneous speech within a game-like context. The game setting itself is subject to change with very little notice. This leads to a very dynamic domain that does not lend itself to deep learning approaches. We are looking at ways to utilize our rule-based system to fine-tune a deep learning system. Currently, we are exploring whether NLP outputs (Dialog Act Labels, Event Labels, Sentiment Labels) of a team-dialogue are predictive of the team members' attitudes towards their team and their conversations.
