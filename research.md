## Language Evolution: CENA
_Collaboration with: Anderson Almeida da Silva (Universidade Federal do Delta do Parnaíba), Shigeru Miyagawa (MIT and University of São Paulo), and Vitor Nóbrega (University of Hamburg)_

_CENA_ is an emergent sign language in Piauí, Brasil, that arose out of a homesign system some 70 years ago (Almeida da Silva & Nevins 2020). We are working on a joint research project to show that (i) humans do not need an external model of language, but can instead devise one of their own (an argument already made by Goldin-Meadow and colleagues in their work on homesign, see for example Brentari \& Goldin-Meadow 2017), and (ii) that a homesign system can quickly progress into a full-fledged sign language if there is a community that uses it. While similar arguments have been made on the case of Nicaraguan Sign Language, we argue that _CENA_ is different because it was not subject to any outside influences during its genesis due to the fact that it arose in a remote village with no access to other sign languages or sign language educators.


## Combinatorial Structures in Animal Communication
_Collaboration with: Alexandra Bosshard, Balthasar Bickel (UZH & NCCR)_

We are working on new ways to infer combinatorial structures in animal communication systems in an unsupervised manner.
