## Research Interests
I like to think about language, both from a theoretical perspective, as well as from a practical engineering perspective. 
These two perspectives will often collide, which makes life interesting. My favourite questions are those where computational approches can inform theory.

  
### Computational Linguistics/NLP
  I am interested in situations where neural approaches to NLP struggle because of limited data, either for lack of data in general, or lack of resources in procuring data. 
  I am also generally interested in situations where computational approaches can inform other linguistic research, such as creating tagged and parsed corpora.

  
### Evolution of Language 
  I am interested in topics pertaining the evolution of language capability in humans. 
  Specifically, I am interested in the phenomena of home-sign and emergent sign languages and how they can inform us on the conditions under which human language can arise.
  In this context, I am also interested in the communication systems of animals.



## Other Interests
  When I'm not working on some language related problem, you can find me on hikes in the mountains or foraging wild mushrooms and berries. Sometimes, 
  when I'm procrastinating, you might even find me replying to github issues of libraries I recently worked with.
