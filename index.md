I am a postdoc at the Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of Language Evolution at the University of Zurich. 

My research is in computational linguistics and its intersection with linguistic theory (Syntax and Language Evolution). I also have an interest in applying research methods from linguistics to animal communication systems. 

For a list of my publications and other work, please see my CV for now as this website is a continuous work in progress.
